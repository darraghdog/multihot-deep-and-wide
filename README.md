# multihot-deep-and-wide

- Execute tenorflow code by running,`python tf_wide.py`. This is our shot at Tensorflow LinearClassifier which did not work so far. We fit the data into a sparsetensor; and then form there into categorical_column, but it does not converge.

- Baseline code for FTRL is taken from  https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/discussion/10927
Execute by running `python py_ftrl_wide.py`
