# multihot-deep-and-wide

- Execute tenorflow code by running,`python tf_wide.py`. This is our shot at Tensorflow LinearClassifier which does not converge. We fit the data into a sparsetensor; and then from there into categorical_column, but it does not converge.

- Baseline code for FTRL (this is converging) is taken from  https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/discussion/10927
Execute by running `python py_ftrl_wide.py`
